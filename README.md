# Common Lisp Reasoner

The Common Lisp Reasoner extends the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) to incorporate a powerful rule language suitable for all kinds of reasoning tasks, vanilla XML and RDF/XML interfaces, and support for a variety of AI-related applications, such as scheduling, planning and diagnosis.

## Status

It has been tested in Allegro 9.0, clisp 2.48, ECL 13.5.1, LispWorks 6.1.1 and SBCL 1.3.5.

It should run unmodified in any Lisp that implements the metaobject protocol, and can be used in conjunction with [Closer to MOP](https://common-lisp.net/project/closer/).
